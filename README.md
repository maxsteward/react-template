This is a basic readme file created via right click > new file in VScode's folder structure. Replace all text here with whatever you want. 

For example, I'll paste below how to create a basic React project and host a simple web page on Github Pages. All code can be copied from the files themselves (files in src folder, index.html, package.json, vite.config.js)


I'll help you set up a free GitHub Pages website with a live development environment. Here's exactly what you need to do:

## Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click the green "New" button to create a new repository
2. Name it `your-username.github.io` (replace "your-username" with your actual GitHub username)
3. Make sure it's set to **Public**
4. Check "Add a README file"
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Clone and Set Up Locally

Open Terminal on your Mac and run these commands:

```bash
# Clone your repository (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-USERNAME.github.io.git
cd YOUR-USERNAME.github.io

# Initialize npm project
npm init -y

# Install Vite and React
npm install vite @vitejs/plugin-react react react-dom

# Install development dependencies
npm install -D @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## Step 3: Create the Project Structure

The main configuration and starter files can be found in the reactTemplate folder within the repo at https://github.com/maxsteward/p1

## Step 4: Create Directory Structure and Files

In VSCode, create this folder structure in your repository:

```
your-username.github.io/
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── main.jsx
│   └── index.css
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── README.md
```

Copy each of the code blocks I provided above into their respective files.

## Step 5: Install Dependencies and Test Locally

In Terminal, navigate to your project folder and run:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Install gh-pages for easy deployment
npm install -D gh-pages

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. You'll see your live preview there, and it will automatically reload when you make changes to your code.

## Step 6: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Once you're happy with your local preview:

```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial site setup"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## Step 7: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io` within a few minutes!

## Development Workflow

- Run `npm run dev` for live local development with hot reload
- Make changes to files in the `src/` folder
- When ready to publish: `npm run build && npm run deploy`

You now have a blank React site running locally with live preview and ready for GitHub Pages deployment.
